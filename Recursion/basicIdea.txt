points to remember while using recursion:
    
    Assumption:
        Decide What your function should do and assume it does

    main logic:
        solving problems with sub problems.
        Example:
            Sum of 5 natural numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.
            here n = 5;
            Sum of n - 1 natural numbers + n
    
    base case:
        when code should stop.
        Example when n reaches 0 my code should stop.
